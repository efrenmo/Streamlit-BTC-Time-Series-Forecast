# Streamlit-BTC-Time-Series-Forecast

I used Prophet, an open source time series forecasting algorithm developed by Facebook’s data science research team, to forecast Bitcoin’s price thirty days into the future. Analysis was based on a univariate multiplicative model where non-linear trends were fit with yearly, and weekly seasonality.

Additionally, I used streamlit python framework to build a web interface to display [**my project.**](https://btc-timeseries-forecast.streamlitapp.com/).

Because of the difficulty some code-hosting or notebook sharing websites have rendering interactive plots and widgets within a Jupyter notebook, and the lack of options these tools provide to control the layout or other elements when it comes to present/share your projects made on Jupyter notebooks, I was motivated to find some sort of an alternative. 

Streamlit emerged as an interesting option to showcase my project. 

[**Streamlit**](https://docs.streamlit.io/) is an open-source python framework for building custom web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. It lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in a shorter timeframe than it would if you were using a JavaScript framework, or other python frameworks such as Flask and Django. 

Here is the web link to my first [**Streamlit web app.**](https://btc-timeseries-forecast.streamlitapp.com/) 

Here are some screenshots of plots from the project made with python library plotly.
