# Streamlit-BTC-Time-Series-Forecast


Because of the difficulty some code-hosting or notebook sharing websites have rendering interactive plots and widgets within a Jupyter notebook, and the lack of options these tools provide to control the layout or other elements when it comes to present/share your projects made on Jupyter notebooks, I was motivated to find some sort of an alternative. 
Streamlit emerged as an interesting option given my background, and direction I want to grow my current toolstack. 

[**Streamlit**](https://docs.streamlit.io/) is an open-source python framework for building custom web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. It lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in a shorter timeframe than it would if you were using a JavaScript framework, or other python frameworks such as Flask and Django. 

Without further ado, here is the web link to my first [**Streamlit web app.**](https://btc-timeseries-forecast.streamlitapp.com/) 

I used a previous project made on a Jupyter notebook and adapted the code to present it as a web app.
